If you are thinking of creating a matrimonial website you can use this boilerplate to quickly get started. It has all the features of a modern matrimonial website such as [profile creation](https://www.bengalimarriage.com/register), profile picture, connecting with other members, private messaging etc. This is not a finished product yet, and currently there are no documentation as to how to install and configure it, but I am working on it and expect it to be added soon.
